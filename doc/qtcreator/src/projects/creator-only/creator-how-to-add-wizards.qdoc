    \title Add wizards

    \QC has wizards for adding classes, files, and projects that you can copy
    and edit to create your own wizards. Create the wizard directory in the
    \c {templates/wizards/} directory in your \l{Locating Wizards}
    {user settings directory}.

    To create a new wizard:

    \list 1

        \li Start \QC with the \c {-customwizard-verbose} argument to receive
            feedback during wizard development. For more information, see
            \l {Verbose Output}.

        \li Set keyboard shortcuts for the \uicontrol Inspect and
            \uicontrol {Factory.Reset} actions, as described in
            \l {Tips for Wizard Development}.

        \li Copy a directory that contains a wizard and rename it. For example,
            copy \c {share/qtcreator/templates/wizards/classes/cpp} as
            \c {$HOME/.config/QtProject/qtcreator/templates/wizards/classes/mycpp}.

        \li Use the \uicontrol {Factory.Reset} action to make the wizard appear
            in \uicontrol File > \uicontrol {New File} without
            restarting \QC.

        \li Open the wizard configuration file, \c {wizard.json} for editing, as
            described in \l {Custom Wizards}.

        \li Change the \c id to something unique. Wizards are sorted by the ID in
            alphabetic order within a \c category. You can use a leading letter
            to specify the position of the wizard. For example, \c B.MyClass.
    \endlist
