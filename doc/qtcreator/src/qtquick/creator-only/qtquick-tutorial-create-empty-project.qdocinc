            \note This tutorial shows how to create the application in the

        \li Select Qt 6.4 or later \l{Kits}{kits} for the

            applications for mobile devices, select kits also for Android and
            iOS.

            \note The list shows kits that you specify in \preferences >
            \uicontrol Kits.
            For more information, see \l {Add kits} and \l {Kits}.

        \li Select \uicontrol Next to open the \uicontrol {Project Management}
            dialog.

        \li Review the project settings, and select \uicontrol{Finish}
            (or \uicontrol Done on \macos) to create the project.

    \endlist
