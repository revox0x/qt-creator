    \title Installation

    You can install either a \e commercial or \e {open source} version of \QC in
    the following ways:

    \list
        \li As a part of a Qt installation with \l{Get and Install Qt}{\QOI}.
        \li As a stand-alone tool.
    \endlist

    You can install and run several \QC versions on the same system and use
    them in parallel.

    \section1 \QOI

    \QOI has both the latest released version of \QC and a beta version or a
    release candidate of the upcoming release, depending on the release cycle.

    \note You need a Qt Account to use \QOI.

    \section1 Standalone \QC

    You can get the open source version of \QC in the following ways:

    \list
        \li Use a package manager
        \li Download an installation package
        \li Build \QC from sources
    \endlist

    Start the \QC installer in the usual way for your system and follow its
    instructions to install \QC.

    To develop with Qt, you also need a Qt version. You can register Qt versions
    in the stand-alone \QC to use them in \l{Kits}{kits}.

    \section2 Using Package Managers

    The \QC packages that package managers offer are not
    officially supported. For links to official releases, see
    \l {Downloading Installation Packages}.

    On Windows you can use \c chocolatey, and on \macos you can use \c brew.
    These package managers install the latest \QC releases available online.
    That is, they pick up the 7zip archives and extract them on your system.

    For example, on Windows, enter:

    \badcode
    choco install qtcreator
    \endcode

    And on \macos, enter:

    \badcode
    brew install --cask qt-creator
    \endcode

    \note Linux distributions might have old \QC versions, so you might want to
    download and install the latest version.

    \section2 Downloading Installation Packages

    You can download \QC installation packages from:

    \list
        \li \l{https://download.qt.io/official_releases/qtcreator/}
            {Official releases}
        \li Your \l{Qt Account} (open source and commercial)
        \li \l{https://download.qt.io/snapshots/qtcreator/}
            {Snapshots of the current and upcoming release}
        \li \l{https://github.com/qt-creator/qt-creator/releases}{GitHub}
    \endlist

    \section2 Building from Sources

    To test the very latest \QC version, maybe with your own changes,
    you can build it from sources. For more information, see
    \l{https://github.com/qt-creator/qt-creator/#compiling-qt-creator}
    {Compiling \QC} and \l{https://wiki.qt.io/Building_Qt_Creator_from_Git}
