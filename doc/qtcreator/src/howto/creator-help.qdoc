    \title Get help

    \QC comes fully integrated with Qt documentation and examples using the Qt
    Help plugin.

    \list

        \li To view documentation, switch to the \uicontrol Help mode.

        \li To view context sensitive help on a Qt class or function as a
            tooltip, move the mouse cursor over the class or function. If help
            is not available, the tooltip shows type information for the
            symbol.

        \li To show tooltips for function signatures regardless of the
            cursor position in the function call, press \key {Ctrl+Shift+D}.

        \li To show the full help on a Qt class or function, press \key F1 or
            select \uicontrol {Context Help} in the context menu.
            The documentation is shown in a
            view next to the code editor, or, if there is not enough vertical
            space, in the fullscreen \uicontrol Help mode.

        \li To change how the documentation is shown in the
            \uicontrol Help mode, go to \preferences > \uicontrol Help.
    \endlist

    \if defined(qtdesignstudio)
    The following image shows the context sensitive help in the \l Code view.

    \image qds-help-in-code-view.webp {Context-sensitive help in the Code view.}
    \else
    The following image shows the context sensitive help in the \uicontrol Edit
    mode.

    \image qtcreator-context-sensitive-help.webp {Context-sensitive help in Edit mode}
    \endif

    \section1 Change the font

    If the help HTML file does not use a style sheet, you can change the font
    family, style, and size in \preferences > \uicontrol Help >
    \uicontrol General.

    \image qtcreator-preferences-help-general.webp {General tab in Help preferences}

    Set the default zoom level in \uicontrol Zoom. When viewing help pages, use
    the mouse scroll wheel to zoom them. To turn off this feature, clear
    \uicontrol {Enable scroll wheel zooming}.

    To turn off antialiasing, clear \uicontrol Antialias.

    \section1 Return to the editor

    To switch to the editor context when you close the last help page, select
    \uicontrol {Return to editor on closing the last page}.

    \section1 Select help viewer backend

    The help viewer backend determines the style sheet that is used to show
    the help files. The default help viewer backend that is based on litehtml
    is recommended for viewing Qt documentation. You can choose another help
    viewer backend in the \uicontrol {Viewer backend}. To take the new
    backend to use, reload the help page.

    \section1 View function tooltips

    To hide function tooltips by default:

    \list 1
        \li Go to \preferences > \uicontrol {Text Editor} > \uicontrol Behavior.
        \image qtcreator-preferences-texteditor-behavior.webp {Text Editor Behavior preferences}
        \li In \uicontrol {Show help tooltips using the mouse}, select
            \uicontrol {On Shift+Mouseover}.
    \endlist

    You can still view the tooltips by pressing and holding down the \key Shift
    key.

    To use a keyboard shortcut for viewing help tooltips, select
    \uicontrol {Show help tooltips using keyboard shortcut (Alt)}.

    \title Find information in Qt documentation

    \QC installer, \QOI, and other Qt deliverables install documentation as .qch
    files. View the documentation in the \uicontrol Help mode. To view the
    currently open document online, select \inlineimage icons/online.png
    (\uicontrol {Open Online Documentation}).

    By default, \QC registers only the latest available version of the
    documentation for each installed Qt module. To register all installed
    documentation, go to \preferences > \uicontrol Kits >
    \uicontrol {Qt Versions} and select an option in
    \uicontrol {Register documentation}.

    \image qtcreator-qt-versions.png {Register documentation in Qt Versions preferences}

    \section1 Help mode sidebar views

    \image qtcreator-sidebar-help-mode.webp {Sidebar views in the Help mode}

    To find information in the documentation in the \uicontrol Help mode, select:

    \list

        \li \uicontrol Bookmarks to view a list of pages on which you have added
            bookmarks.

        \li \uicontrol Contents to see all the documentation installed on the
            development PC and to browse the documentation contents.

        \li \uicontrol Index to find information based on a list of keywords in all
            the installed documents.

        \li \uicontrol {Open Pages} to view a list of currently open documentation
            pages.

        \li \uicontrol Search to search from all the installed documents.

    \title Add bookmarks to help pages

    Add bookmarks to useful help pages to easily find them later
    in the \uicontrol Bookmarks view. Either use the page title as the
    bookmark or change it to any text. You can organize the bookmarks in
    folders in the view.

    \image qtcreator-help-add-bookmark-dlg.png {Add Bookmark dialog}

    To add a bookmark to an open help page:

    \list 1

        \li Select \inlineimage icons/bookmark.png (\uicontrol {Add Bookmark})
            on the toolbar.

        \li In the \uicontrol {Add Bookmark} dialog, select \uicontrol OK to save the
            page title as a bookmark in the selected folder.

    \endlist

    \section1 Import and export bookmarks

    To import and export bookmarks, go to \preferences > \uicontrol Help >
    \uicontrol General and select \uicontrol {Import Bookmarks} or
    \uicontrol {Export Bookmarks}.

    \title Search from documentation

    In the \uicontrol Help mode \uicontrol Search pane, use full-text
    search for finding a
    particular word in all the installed documents. Enter the term you are
    looking for, and select \uicontrol Search. All documents that
    have the specified term are listed. The list is sorted by document
    version (if you have installed several Qt versions, for example) and
    the number of search hits that the documents have. Select a document in
    the list to open it.

    \image qtcreator-help-search.png {Help mode Search pane}

    The following are examples of common search patterns:

    \list

        \li \c deep lists all the documents that have the word \c deep.
            The search is not case sensitive.

        \li \c{deep*} lists all the documents that have a word beginning
            with \c deep

        \li \c{deep copy} lists all documents that have both \c deep and
            \c copy

        \li \c{"deep copy"} lists all documents that have the phrase
            \c{deep copy}

    \endlist

    Full-text search is based on indexing all the installed documents the first
    time when you open the \uicontrol Search pane. If you add or remove documents,
    \QC recreates the index.

    If you cannot find words that you know are there, the index might not be
    complete. To recreate it, select \inlineimage icons/reload_gray.png
    (\uicontrol {Regenerate Index}).

    Punctuation is not included in indexed terms. To find terms that have
    punctuation, such as domain names, use the asterisk as a wild card. For
    example, to find \c {Pastebin.Com}, enter the search term \c {Pastebin*}.

    \title Add external documentation

    You can view external documentation in the \uicontrol Help mode.
    To add documentation or replace the documentation that ships with \QC and Qt:

    \list 1

        \li Create a .qch file from your documentation.

            For information on how to prepare your documentation and create a
            .qch file, see \l{The Qt Help Framework}.

        \li To add the .qch file to \QC, go to \preferences >

    \title Detach the help window

    By default, context-sensitive help opens in a window next to the
    code editor when you press \key F1. If there is not enough vertical
    space, the help opens in the full-screen help mode.

    \if defined(qtdesignstudio)

    To specify that the help always opens in full-screen mode or in an external
    window, go to \preferences > \uicontrol Help > \uicontrol General.

    \image qtcreator-preferences-help-general.webp {General tab in Help preferences}

    Set preferences for viewing context-sensitive help
    in \uicontrol {On context help}. To detach the help window, select
    \uicontrol {Always Show in External Window}.

    To change this setting in a help view, select \inlineimage icons/linkicon.png.

            are not opened because loading them would slow down opening the \uicontrol Help
            mode.

        \li To show a particular page, select \uicontrol {Show My Home Page}, and specify
            the page in \uicontrol {Home Page}.
