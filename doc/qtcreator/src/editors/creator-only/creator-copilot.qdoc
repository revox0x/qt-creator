    \title Use GitHub Copilot

    The Copilot plugin (disabled by default) integrates
    \l{https://github.com/features/copilot}{GitHub Copilot} into \QC.
    You can view suggestions from Copilot in the \uicontrol Edit mode.

    \note If you enable the Copilot plugin, you must agree with and abide by
    the GitHub terms of use. It is your responsibility to know and accept the
    requirements and parameters of using Copilot, such as ensuring you have
    the rights to grant it access to your code. Also, you must understand the
    implications of using it and the suggestions it produces, such as code
    copyright and accuracy.

    \section1 Requirements

    To use the Copilot plugin, you need:

    \list
        \li An active \l{https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-copilot/about-billing-for-github-copilot}
            {GitHub Copilot subscription}.
        \li GitHub Copilot Neovim plugin installed (requires Node.js), as described in
            \l{https://github.com/github/copilot.vim/blob/release/README.md}
            {Copilot.vim/Readme.md}.

            Node.js executable.

            for the current text cursor position when you make changes.
        \li Select \uicontrol {Use proxy} to use a proxy server to
            connect to Copilot servers.
        \li In \uicontrol {Proxy host}, enter the host name of the proxy server.
        \li In \uicontrol {Proxy port}, enter the port number of the
            proxy server.
        \li Select \uicontrol {Reject unauthorized} to prevent the
            security risk presented by accepting unauthorized certificates from
            the proxy server.
        \li In \uicontrol {Proxy user}, enter the user name to
            authenticate to the proxy server.
        \li Select \uicontrol {Save proxy password} to save the
            password to authenticate to the proxy server.
            \note The password is saved insecurely.

    \section1 Receive suggestions

    When you write code in the \l {Edit Mode}{Edit} mode and
    \uicontrol {Auto request} is enabled, Copilot automatically makes
    suggestions when you type.

    To manually request a suggestion at the current editor's cursor position,
    enter \uicontrol {t} (\uicontrol {Request Copilot Suggestion}) in the
