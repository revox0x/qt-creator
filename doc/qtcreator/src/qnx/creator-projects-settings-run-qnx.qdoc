    \title QNX Run Settings

    \brief Settings for running applications on Linux-based devices.

    Specify settings for running applications on the \l {Kits}{Run device} that
    you select for a kit in \uicontrol Projects > \uicontrol {Build & Run} >
    \uicontrol Run > \uicontrol {Run Settings}.

    To run and debug an application on a QNX device, select
    \uicontrol {Manage device configurations} to create a
    connection between \QC and the device.

    Settings for QNX Neutrino devices are very similar to those for remote linux
    devices.
