    \title 3D

    \brief Edit a 3D scene.

    When editing a 3D scene, you view the scene in the \uicontrol{3D}
    view.

    When you import 3D scenes from files that you exported from 3D graphics
    tools, you also import a \l{Cameras}{scene camera},
    \l{Lights}{light}, \l{3D Models}{model}, and \l {Materials and Shaders}{materials}.
    If your scene does not contain them, add the corresponding \l {3D Components}{Qt Quick 3D}
    components from \uicontrol Components > \inlineimage icons/plus.png
    > \uicontrol {Qt Quick 3D} > \uicontrol {Qt Quick 3D}.

    Use the \uicontrol 3D toolbar buttons to modify the \uicontrol 3D view,
    manipulate the 3D scene, and to access functionalities to \e transform 3D
    components. Transformation refers to moving, rotating, or scaling a
    component. The \e pivot of the component is used as the origin for
    transformations. Set a \l{Managing 3D Transformations}{local pivot offset}
    for a component in \uicontrol Properties to transform the component around
    a point other than its local origin. A line is drawn in the \uicontrol{3D}
    view from the pivot point to the center of the component to provide a visual
    connection between them.

    \note To avoid transforming components by mistake while editing your scene,
    use the \l {Showing and Hiding Components}{showing and hiding} or the
    \l {Locking Components}{locking} features in \l Navigator.

    To refresh the contents of the \uicontrol{3D} view, press \key P or
    select the \inlineimage icons/reset.png
    (\uicontrol {Reset View}) button.

    \section1 Using the Context Menu in the 3D View

    There is a context menu in the \uicontrol 3D view. To open it, right-click
    in the \uicontrol 3D view. From the context menu you can, for example:
    \list
      \li Create cameras, lights, and models.
      \li Open \uicontrol {Material Editor} and edit materials.
      \li Delete components.
      \li Align camera views.
    \endlist

    \image 3d-view-context-menu.webp "The context menu in the 3D view"

    \section1 Controlling the 3D View Camera

    \section2 Toggling Camera Mode

    Change the projection of the view by switching between \e {perspective camera}
    and \e {orthographic camera} modes. When using the perspective camera mode,
    components that are far from the camera appear smaller than those nearby. In
    the orthographic camera mode, all components appear at the same scale
    irrespective of their distance from the camera. Both of them are free-form
    camera modes that you can use to orbit around the scene.

    To toggle the camera mode, do one of the following:
    \list
        \li Select \inlineimage perspective_camera.png
         (\uicontrol {Toggle Perspective/Orthographic Camera}) to use the
         perspective camera mode.
        \li Select \inlineimage orthographic_camera.png to use the orthographic
        camera mode.
    \endlist
    You can also toggle the camera mode by using the keyboard shortcut \key T.

    \section2 Navigating in the 3D Scene

    Navigate the scene by panning, rotating, and zooming the 3D view
    camera:

    \list
        \li To pan, press \key Alt (or \key Option on \macos) and use the
            wheel button to drag anywhere in the \uicontrol 3D view to
            slide the view around. Alternatively, press and hold \key
            {right mouse button} and \key {left mouse button} and drag
            anywhere in the view to pan.
        \li To orbit, press \key Alt and and drag anywhere in the
            \uicontrol 3D view to rotate the view.
        \li To zoom, use the mouse wheel or press \key Alt and right-click
            anywhere in the \uicontrol 3D view to zoom the view in or out as you drag
            up or down.
    \endlist

    To zoom and focus the 3D view camera on a selected component, select
    \inlineimage fit_selected.png (\uicontrol {Fit Selected}) or press \key F.

    The world axis helper (1) shows the direction of the world axes in the view.
    To point the 3D view camera at the currently selected component in the direction of
    an axis, click the axis. Clicking the dot at the end of the axis will point
    the camera at the opposite direction of the axis. If no component is
    selected, the camera is pointed at the world origin.

    \image studio-3d-editor-axis-helper.webp "Axis helper in the 3D view"

    Use scene cameras (2) to view the \uicontrol View3D component from a
    specific angle in the \l {2D} view while editing scenes. Drag a camera
    component to your scene from \uicontrol Components > \uicontrol {Qt Quick 3D} >
    \uicontrol {Qt Quick 3D}. For more information about using cameras in the
    scene and the available camera types, see \l{Cameras}.

    \section2 Using Split View

    To view the scene in a split view of four different point of views, select
    \inlineimage icons/split-view.png.

    \image studio-3d-split-view.webp "Split view in the 3D view"

    To select one of the four panes, click the pane. The selected pane is marked with
    a blue frame. Use the world axis helper to change the point of view for each pane
    independently. Navigate each split by panning, rotating, and zooming, as
    described above.

    \section2 Using Fly Mode

    Use the fly mode to move around freely in the 3D scene. To navigate the scene with
    fly mode, right-click and hold in the \uicontrol 3D view, and use the keyboard shortcuts
    to move around the scene:

    \table
    \header
        \li Key
        \li Action
    \row
        \li \key W or \key {Up arrow}
        \li Move forward.
    \row
        \li \key S or \key {Down arrow}
        \li Move backward.
    \row
        \li \key A or \key {Left arrow}
        \li Move left.
    \row
        \li \key D or \key {Right arrow}
        \li Move right.
    \row
        \li \key E or \key {Page up}
        \li Move up.
    \row
        \li \key Q or \key {Page down}
        \li Move down.
    \row
        \li \key Shift
        \li Move faster.
    \row
        \li \key Alt
        \li Move slower.
    \row
        \li \key Spacebar
        \li Move to an object in the crosshairs.
    \endtable

    To adjust the movement speed, right-click and hold in the \uicontrol 3D view, and rotate the
    mouse wheel. Alternatively, select \inlineimage icons/camera_speed.png in the \uicontrol 3D
    view toolbar to open the configuration dialog.

    In the configuration dialog, you can:
    \list
        \li Adjust the movement speed of the camera with a slider.
        \li Set a value multiplier for the speed slider.
    \endlist

    \section1 Using Global and Local Orientation

    In \uicontrol 3D view, you view the scene in global or local orientation
    mode.

    In global orientation mode, transformation of a selected component is
    presented with respect to the global space. For example, while the move tool
    is selected, selecting a cube will show its move gizmo aligned with the axes
    of global space. Dragging on the red arrow of the gizmo moves the component
    in the global x direction.

    In local orientation mode, the position of a selected component is shown
    according to local axes specific to the selected component. For example,
    selecting a rotated cube will show its axes rotated, and not aligned with
    the axes of global space. Dragging on the red arrow of the gizmo moves the
    component in the local x direction in relation to the component.

    To switch between local and global orientation, select \inlineimage global.png
    (\uicontrol {Toggle Local/Global Orientation}) or press \key Y.

    \section1 Using Edit Light

    The edit light is an extra point light that can be used to illuminate the
    scene. To toggle the edit light on and off, select \inlineimage edit_light_on.png
    or \inlineimage edit_light_off.png (\uicontrol {Toggle Edit Light}) or
    press \key U.

    For information about the available scene light types and their properties,
    see \l{Lights}.

    \section1 Baking Lights

    Bake lights to light static elements in your scene. To bake lights, select
    \inlineimage icons/bakelights.png to open the \uicontrol {Lights Baking Setup}
    dialog. For more information, see \l {Baking Lightmaps}.

    \section1 Selecting Components

    To move, rotate, or scale components in the scene, you need to select them
    first. Toggle the selection mode to determine how components are selected
    when you click them in the \uicontrol{3D} view:

    \list
        \li Use the \inlineimage select_item.png (\uicontrol {Single Selection})
            mode to select a single component.
        \li Use the \inlineimage select_group.png (\uicontrol {Group Selection})
            mode to select the top level parent of the component, so you can move
            a group of components simultaneously.
    \endlist

    Alternatively, press \key Q to toggle the selection mode.

    To multiselect, hold \key Ctrl and click the components you wish to select.

    After selecting a component, you can apply the usual \l {Keyboard Shortcuts}
    {keyboard shortcuts} applicable to your operating system, for example,
    \key Ctrl+C and \key Ctrl+V on Windows to copy-paste components.

    \target moving components 3d view
    \section1 Moving Components

    \image studio-3d-editor-move.webp "The 3D view in move mode"

    You can move components in relation to their coordinate system, along the x,
    y, or z axis or on the top, bottom, left, and right clip planes of the
    the \uicontrol{3D} view.

    To move components, select \inlineimage move_off.png or press \key W:

    \list
        \li To move components along the axes of the move gizmo, click the axis,
            and drag the component along the axis.
        \li To move components on a plane, drag the plane handle of the move
            component on the plane.
        \li To move components freely in the 3D view, drag the gray handle at the
            center of the move gizmo.
     \endlist

    \section1 Rotating Components

    \image studio-3d-editor-rotate.webp "The 3D view in rotate mode"

    To rotate components, select \inlineimage rotate_off.png
    or press \key E:

    \list
        \li To rotate a component around its rotation gizmo, drag the axis ring
            in the direction you want to rotate the component in.
        \li To freely rotate the component, drag the inner center circle of the
            gizmo.
    \endlist

    \section1 Scaling Components

    \image studio-3d-editor-scale.webp "The 3D view in scale mode"

    Úse the scale handles to adjust the local x, y, or z scale of a
    component. You can adjust the scale across one, two, or three axes,
    depending on the handle.

    To scale components, select \inlineimage scale_off.png or press \key R:

    \list
        \li To adjust the scale across one axis, drag the scale handle
            attached to the axis.
        \li To adjust the scale across a plane, drag the plane handle of
            the component.
        \li To uniformly scale a component across all axes, drag the
            gray handle at the center of the component.
    \endlist

    \section1 Snapping

    With snapping turned on, the objects in the \uicontrol 3D view snap to certain
    intervals during transformation (move, rotate, scale).

    Toggle snapping in the following ways:

    \list
      \li Select \inlineimage icons/snapping-3d.png
      in the \uicontrol 3D view toolbar.
      \li Hold down the \key Ctrl key.
    \endlist

    With snapping turned on, press and hold \key Shift to snap objects to one tenth of
    the specified snap interval.

    \section2 Configuring Snapping

    To edit the snapping settings, select \inlineimage icons/snapping-3d-conf.png
    in the \uicontrol 3D view toolbar to open the configure dialog.

    In the configure dialog, you can do the following:
    \list
      \li Turn snapping on and off separately for the different transformations
      (move, rotate, scale).
      \li Set snap intervals for the transformations.
      \note Changing the snap interval for the position also changes the grid line intervals.
      \note All the grid lines might not be visible depending on the zoom level in the 3D view.
      \li Select \uicontrol {Absolute Position} to snap to absolute values. Clear the checkbox
       to use relative values.The absolute snapping aligns the object with the grid, while the
       relative snapping moves the object in fixed intervals without changing its alignment.
       For example, if you have an object that is slightly off the grid and you want to snap it
       to the grid, use the absolute snapping. If you want to move the object by a certain
       distance without affecting its orientation, use the relative snapping.
    \endlist

    \section1 Aligning Views and Cameras

    To align a camera to the \uicontrol{3D} view:
    \list 1
      \li Select a scene camera in the \uicontrol{3D} or \uicontrol {Navigator} view.
      \note If you don't have a camera selected, the most recently selected camera
      is aligned to the view.
      \li In the \uicontrol{3D} view, select \inlineimage icons/align-camera-on.png.
    \endlist

    This moves and rotates the scene camera to show the same view as the current view
    in the \uicontrol{3D} view.

    To align the \uicontrol{3D} view to a camera:
    \list 1
      \li Select a scene camera in the \uicontrol{3D} view or \uicontrol {Navigator}.
      \note If you don't have a camera selected, the view is aligned to the most recently
            selected camera.
      \li In the \uicontrol{3D} view, select \inlineimage icons/align-view-on.png.
    \endlist

    This moves and rotates the 3D view to show the same view as the selected scene camera.

    \section1 Toggling Visibility
