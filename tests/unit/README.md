# Contribution Guideline

This document summarizes;

* Best practices for writing tests
* How the test folder is organized
* How to add a new test
* How to build only specific test

All tests here depend on the [GoogleTest][1] framework.

## Best Practices

We follow these patterns/approaches for structuring our tests:

Arrange, Act, and Assert (AAA) / Given When Then (GWT)

This pattern structures your tests into three distinct sections:

    Arrange (Given): Set up the initial conditions and inputs.
    Act (When): Execute the code being tested.
    Assert (Then): Verify the result.

The test name is descriptive and uses underlines for readability.
In the Act block, only the code you want to test should exist. Don't
add the setup code there. It makes the debugging harder because you have
to step over it.

```cpp
TEST(String, default_string_is_empty)
{
    String text;

    bool isEmpty = text.empty();

    ASSERT_TRUE(isEmpty);
}
```

If the code block gets hard to read, you can write Arrange, Act, and Assert comments.
So the blocks are easier to identify. Don't write other comments. Use a descriptive
test name.

```cpp
TEST(String, default_string_is_empty)
{
    // arrange
    String text;

    // act
    bool isEmpty = text.empty();

    // assert
    ASSERT_TRUE(isEmpty);
}
```

If you use a fixture, you can sometimes skip the arrange part.

Fixtures should have the same name as your class. If you test functions,
it is the namespace. Sometimes you need multiple fixtures. Then you append
a descriptive text. You can put an underline in between.

```cpp
class String : public ::testing::Test
{
protected:
    String text;
}

TEST_F(String, default_string_is_empty)
{
    bool isEmpty = text.empty();

    ASSERT_TRUE(isEmpty);
}
```
For mocks, you have to reverse the order of act and assert.

```cpp
class String : public ::testing::Test
{
protected:
    NiceMock<OutputMock> outputMock;
    Printer printer;
}

TEST_F(String, printer_appends_message_to_the_end)
{
    // arrange
    String text;

    // assert
    EXPECT_CALL(outputMock, print(EndsWith(text)))

    // act
    printer.print(text);
}
```

Don't write loops or branches in tests. Google Tests has many facilities supporting you to write clear tests.

Matcher, for example, gives a much better error message.

```cpp
TEST_F(Storage, return_all_entries_with_the_name_which_starts_with_foo)
{
    storage.load(filepath);

    auto entries = storage.entries("foo*");

    ASSERT_THAT(entries, UnorderedElementsAre(IsEntry("foo", Field(&Entry::values), Contains(5)),
                                              IsEntry("fooBar", Field(&Entry::values), IsSubset(42, 77))));
}
```

You can even make the matcher easier to read.

```cpp
template<typename Matcher>
auto FieldValues(const Matcher &matcher)
{
    return Field(&Entry::values, matcher);
}

TEST_F(Storage, return_all_entries_with_the_name_which_starts_with_foo)
{
    storage.load(filepath);

    auto entries = storage.entries("foo*");

    ASSERT_THAT(entries, UnorderedElementsAre(IsEntry("foo", FieldValues(Contains(5)),
                                              IsEntry("fooBar", FieldValues(IsSubset(42, 77))));
}
```

## Avoid

Don't use using namespaces. It leads easily to name collisions.

```cpp
using namespace QmlDesigner;
```

If you have long namespace names, you can use:

```cpp
namespace ModelUtils = QmlDesigner::ModelUtils;
```

You can import single types too. But mind, that your tests are written
for reading, not for writing. They are part of the code documentation.

```cpp
using QmlDesigner::ModelNode;
using Node = QmlDesigner::ModelNode;
```

There are exceptions like literal namespaces.

```cpp
using namespace Qt::Literals;
```

## Test Organization

Here is the general folder structure;

```cpp
unit (main CMakeLists.txt)
|- README.md
|- 3rdparty // 3rd party dependencies
|  `- googletest
|- tools    // custom tools for testing
|   `- your-custom-folder
`- tests    // all tests are here, they all extend main CMake
    |- integrationtests // integration tests, executable
    |- matchers         // custom google-test matchers for testing, library
    |- mocks            // mocks for testing, library
    |- stubs            // stubs for testing, library or executable
    |- printers         // custom google-test matcher printers for testing, library
    |- unittests        // unit tests are here, executable
    `- utils            // common utilities which are mostly included by tests
```

Unit test and integration test folders are structured as the following;

```cpp
unittests (and integrationtests)
|- â€ est-folder-1        // folder for a specific test cluster (or test set)
|   |- CMakelists.txt   // cmake file for extending main CMake
|   |- data             // data folder for testing
|   `- foo-test.cpp     // necessary test files
`- test-folder-2
    |- CMakelists.txt
    |- data
    `- foo-test.cpp
```

## Adding a New Test

* Please add your tests under  `tests/unittest` or `tests/integrationtest` folder.
* Always add your tests to a specific test folder. Please check the test organization section for more information.
* If you need to add a new test folder;
    * Create a new folder
    * Create a new CMakeLists.txt file
    * Add your test files to the folder
    * Add your test data to the folder. Please use `data` folder for test data.
    * Add `unittest_copy_data_folder()` to your CMakeLists.txt file to copy your test data to the build folder.
    * You can access test data from your test code with `UNITTEST_DIR` macro followed by `<your-folder-name>/data` path.
* Name your test files as `foo-test.cpp`.
* Always include `googletest.h` header. Without that you may get the printer function can be broken because the are not anymore ODR (because of weak linking to printers for example). It is also necessary for nice printers, also adds Qt known matchers.
* Use snake_case for the test name to improve readability for long sentences

## Building Tests

> Note:
> When you're building the application from the terminal, you can set environment variables instead of settings CMake flags.
> The corresponding environment variable name is same with CMake variable name but with a 'QTC_' prefix.
> CMake Variable: WITH_TESTS
> Environment Variable: QTC_WITH_TESTS

You have to enable tests with the following CMake variable otherwise the default configuration skips them.

```bash
WITH_TESTS=ON
```

## Building Specific Tests

After enabling tests you can use test-specific CMake flags to customize which tests should be built instead of building all of them at once. Please check the relevant CMake file to see which variable is required to enable that specific test.

```bash
BUILD_TESTS_BY_DEFAULT=OFF
BUILD_TEST_UNITTEST=ON
BUILD_TEST_TST_QML_TESTCORE=ON
```
